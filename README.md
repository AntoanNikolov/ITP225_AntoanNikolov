## Final Project  
I made a Python piano with a looper so you can jam out at will! I used the Pygame midi library to import all notes and octaves quicker. Upon pressing R, the program begins recording player keystrokes by adding them to a list, along with the time at which they are pressed. When the player presses Space for playback, we have a loop checking where we currently are in the playback loop to decide what note to play. It  chscks the current time, when the loop started and the length of the loop. [Project is available here](https://github.com/AntoanNikolov/Python-Piano-with-Looper)
